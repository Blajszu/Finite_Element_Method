# Acoustic Vibration of a Material Layer - Galerkin Method
This repository implements a numerical solution for the acoustic vibration of a material layer using the Galerkin method. The code computes the solution of a differential equation with a finite element approach and visualizes the result through a Tkinter-based GUI and Matplotlib. Users can input the number of grid points and generate a plot of the solution.
